# Data Science Core Independent Project Week 7

## __Regression Analysis of Housing Dataset__ ##


## _Description_ ##

Real estate companies can always improve their businesses with incorporation of machine learning models to help predict housing prices. The business problem given a dataset which contains information on real estate properties that was collected over a couple of months is to study the factors that affect housing prices. Thereafter, create a model that would allow a real estate company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.
